 - java 8, lambdas and Task.spawn (sriram)
 - runtime weaver
 - runtime trampoline
 - continuations (pure fibers) and fiber recycling
     offers dramatic speedup (20x) if scheduling is not required, eg for state machines
 - affine thread pool scheduler (concept by hedvig)
 - reduced synchronization in Task (hedvig)
 - high performance single producer and single consumer mailboxes (nilang)
 - no-context-switch timerservice (nilang)
 - ASM5
 - kilim web server: keepalive and expose query components
 - simplified class mirrors and detectors
 - hybrid build: maven for dependencies and ant for tests
 - maven plugin for weaving within a pom.xml
 - demo projects (battle royale, jetty)
 - idledown: automatically stop kilim when outstanding tasks complete
 - bytecode weaver bugfixes (nqzero, sriram)
 - maven packages for the cental repository



taken as a whole, 2.0 represents a significant step forwards over 1.0
